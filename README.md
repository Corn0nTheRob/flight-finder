# flight-finder
Final Project for Distributed App Development.
Please run the API before running the client.
A few things to note:
The page layout is a repurposed bootstrap template.
The search function only supports Airport codes as locations (for example, JFK and LAX).
Searching for one way flights is currently disabled.
